Play as one of 36 unique Heroes with powerful abilities! The same DotA map you know and love, but with custom Heroes and items.

Each Hero has been designed to feel powerful and impactful, with custom particles and sounds.

Upgrade late game items into their Exalted variants to crush your opposition, and buy into one of many new items, including the Holding Orb, Iris and Soul Vial.

Play the game mode as a 5v5/3v3 for the best experience. Please discuss any bugs, glitches or balance issues you find in the discussions.

Current Version: 1.93c - Hotfix 2

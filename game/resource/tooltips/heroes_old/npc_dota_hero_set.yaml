    bio: ''
    hype: A sieger and teamfighter, Set functions best in messy fights where he will
      not be interrupted whilst channelling his devastating An Army Beneath the Sands.
      Focused on creating powerful Sand Puppets through his Sands of War and Ultimate,
      he can quickly push down towers if not kept in check. His Harsh Sun passive
      grants him bonus regeneration and slows enemies' attack speed during the day,
      globally.

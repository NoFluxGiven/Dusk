    bio: ''
    hype: Mindflayer, as the name implies, can destroy most casters. While his Ultimate,
      Vorpal Assault, may be strong, his real signature ability is his devastating
      Mana Seal, an area of effect spell that gradually drains the Mana of enemies
      standing in it. Should they reach zero Mana, they are mini-stunned, slowed,
      and take Magical damage, allowing him to continue his onslaught of stuns and
      Mana burning crits.

        Teleri fires a bolt of electricity towards the target
        enemy, dealing %damage% damage and electrically
        charging them for %duration% seconds. Each attack Teleri makes against
        the affected unit slows by %slow%%% for %slow_duration% seconds,
        and adds another level of charge, refreshing the debuff. When this ability
        is next cast on that target, they take %damage% damage
        and are stunned for %stun_duration%, per charge.

        turn rate by %slow%%%. Places 1 random item
        on cooldown for between %cooldown_min% and %cooldown_max%
        seconds per attack. If the item is already on cooldown,
        this increases its cooldown by the amount instead.

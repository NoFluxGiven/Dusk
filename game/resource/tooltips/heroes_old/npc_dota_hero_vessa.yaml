Hero:
  data:
    bio: ''
    hype: A combo-oriented Hero, Vessa's Spells are powerful and versatile, with the ability to augment the last Spell cast with her signature
      Imbue. A typical combo of Vessa's involves using <i>Windfall</i> to drag enemies in, then <i>Imbue</i> to cast <i>Aerial Strike (AIR)</i>,
      <i>Stonewall</i> to stun them and add some damage into
      the mix, <i>Sleet Wave</i> to deal more damage and slow them, and she finishes with <i>Inferno</i>
      as she lands from <i>Imbue's Aerial Strike</i>, landing them square in the spinning fire ring and dealing
      massive damage.

    hype: A late game carry, Astaroth's job is to hit you five times with his Black
      Insignia to deal his damage. What he lacks in sturdiness he more than makes
      up for in spells, with access to a slow that activates upon the target taking
      damage (Pain Curse), that transforms the target into a walking bomb (Overwhelm),
      and a devastating Ultimate that does its best to erase their existence (Erase).

    bio: 'Once a member of Epoch''s Counsel, a group of knights and mages selected
      by a god''s hand, Siegfried was known as the Protector of All, the Right Hand
      of Epoch. Wielding a shield that could twist time itself, and a sword that could
      bend space to his will, his influence spanned centuries upon centuries, helping
      the weak and purging evil from the lands. When another member, the Mouthpiece
      of Epoch, began plotting against the people in His name, Siegfried tried all
      he could to stop him, and to prove Epoch''s continued love for humanity, despite
      the Mouthpiece''s mad ramblings of power and destruction. As each of his fellow
      Counsel members turned against him, Siegfried had but one option remaining:
      travel to the deepest pits of the Below, obtain the Demon''s Fire, absorbing
      it into his sword, and use its power to cut through Epoch''s protection, ridding
      the world of the treacherous Mouthpiece. Upon his return, he went to strike
      the Mouthpiece to find he had been tricked. His blade, possessed by the Fire''s
      malicious intent, cut down every member of the Counsel as he weeped, leaving
      him the sole survivor. He now travels, cursed sword in one hand, and the time-bending
      Eon Shield in the other, seeking to atone to Epoch for his sins...'
    hype: A dangerous foe and valuable ally, the Demonfire Knight commands respect
      from his enemies in battle, with huge AoE stuns, a powerful attack steroid,
      and the ability to globally assist an ally for a short time.

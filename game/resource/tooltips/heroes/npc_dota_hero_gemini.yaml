    hype: Eccentric, perhaps, but undoubtably skilled, the Voidwalker can crush opposition
      with a set of dangerous abilities, including a purging bolt of pure energies,
      a portal that can transport allies to anywhere on the map, a pact with a being
      from beyond, and a terrifying vortex of abyssal energies that pulls enemies
      into the centre with ease.

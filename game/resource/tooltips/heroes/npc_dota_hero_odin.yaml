      description: Odin throws his spear at a target location globally.  After a 2s
        delay, the spear lands with destructive impact, dealing large Magical damage
        to all those unfortunate enough to be caught in the blast, and stunning them.  For
        a short while afterwards, Odin's attacks are far weaker and shorter range,
        until his spear returns to his person.\n\nUpgradable by Aghanim's Scepter.

Hero:
  data:
    hype: A supportive tank, Odin's claim to fame is his legendary spear, Gungnir.
      Capable of being cast globally, this has a short delay before landing and stunning
      and damaging anyone in the radius. Otherwise, he possesses a great escape tool
      in Sleipnir's Veil, a difficult to get around defense against right clickers
      in Oppression, and a powerful True Sight AoE spell that punishes invisible units
      in Eye of Truth.

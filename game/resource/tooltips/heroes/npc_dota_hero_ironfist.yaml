    bio: White, pockmarked knuckles gripped the wooden frame. A glint in the dark;
      eyes darting to and fro, surveying their surroundings carefully for any sign
      of movement. A moment later, the figure slipped into the shadows of the room,
      the door closing gently behind him. Many had come to seek the Lost One, to destroy
      him and the twisted reality he represented. This man, however, was different.
      He sought more than simple destruction. He wished to learn the Lost One's ways,
      and become powerful. So was born the Ironfist; master of every method of fighting.
    hype: 'Master of many arts, Ironfist is a powerful adversary. Equipped with three
      sets of skills that he can switch between, and three modes: tank, high damage
      or speed, Ironfist is capable of adapting to most situations very quickly.'

        Spell will consume all stacks, whereas attacking will consume 1 stack, and
        prevent it from ticking up for a short time.\nRegardless of what Stance he
        is in, casting a Spell will cause its cooldown to be reduced based on the
        amounts of Focus stacks he has.\n\nUpgradable by Aghanim's Scepter.

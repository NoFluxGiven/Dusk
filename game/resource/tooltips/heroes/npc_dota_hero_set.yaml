    hype: A sieger and teamfighter, Set functions best in messy fights where he will
      not be interrupted whilst channelling his devastating An Army Beneath the Sands.
      Focused on creating powerful Sand Puppets through his Sands of War and Ultimate,
      he can quickly push down towers if not kept in check. His Harsh Sun passive
      grants him bonus regeneration and slows enemies' attack speed during the day,
      globally.

      description: Set kicks up two sand clouds that travel quickly and pass through

        two Sand Puppets are spawned.  Sand Archers have large attack range that scales
        with level but low damage, and Sand Warriors have short attack range but high
        damage plus bonus movespeed that scales with level, and both last %time% seconds.  Sand
        Puppets are based upon Set's level, not the level of this skill.

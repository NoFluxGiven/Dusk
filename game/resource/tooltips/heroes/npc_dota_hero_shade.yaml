    bio: Few possess a reputation capable of striking fear into the Arca of the realm,
      but the Nightwalker was one. A veteran assassin, and a slayer of countless mages,
      he tore across Lochraith at the drop of a coin, seemingly unstoppable. Not all
      lives were his, however; a young Arca had seen him coming days in advance, and
      set a devious trap. Caught in a powerful binding spell, he prepared to take
      his last breath, but the Arca hesitated. For all the trouble he had caused,
      all those he had killed in the name of avarice, he deserved worse than death.
      His punishment would forever be wandering a dark void, unable to escape, with
      no need for material goods, with no quarries to find. She hastily weaved a dark,
      terrible curse, full of isolation and solitude. But curses are fickle creatures,
      born of terrible, turbulent emotions. She realised her mistake all but a second
      too late. Using the very threads she had weaved prior, the Nightwalker tore
      her from the plane, imprisoning her in a desolate realm, using his undying connection
      with her to weave dark magic of his own.
    hype: Shade is a powerful Agility Hero that relies on his enemies being isolated
      to deal his damage. His blades are coated in Darkwyrm Venom, dealing damage
      based on the amount of debuffs his opponent has. He can Stalk a target to inflict
      a large amount of Physical damage and slow, and he can sustain in fights with
      his terrifying Dark Hunger. His Ultimate, Isolation, may remove an enemy from
      their allies, crippling their ability to deal damage.

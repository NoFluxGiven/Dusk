    hype: Fate is an extremely difficult but highly rewarding character to use. Frail
      and slow, but possessing a multitude of devastating spells that can function
      as both support or offensive abilities, Fate can destroy most enemies given
      enough space in a fight. Wrap your opponents in chains that bond their destinies
      together, dealing damage as nearby units take damage, reduce the damage your
      allies take with Displace, heal and damage in an AoE with Realign, and grant
      you, or an ally, the stat power of extra levels, with Ancestral Recall.

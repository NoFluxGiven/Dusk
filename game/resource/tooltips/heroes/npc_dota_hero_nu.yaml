    bio: ''
    hype: A disabler, nuker, and teamfighter, Nu is dangerous at all stages of the
      game. Possessing the strongest slow and Physical damage nuke in the game, Gravity
      Pulse, a damage augmenter with Micronebulae, numerous deadly floating mines
      with Antimatter Mines, and a powerful Ult, Warpstar, that can pull enemies in
      from thousands of units away and stun them, Nu is devastating if played correctly.

    bio: ''
    hype: A scary bear. Difficult to run from once he gets a few hits off, Fury is
      a powerful ganker and carry due to his incredible Bloodsport and Rend abilities,
      a damage over time per hit and max health reduction per hit, respectively. His
      Q is Roar, empowering him for each unit hit in its AoE for bonus attack speed,
      movespeed and damage, and his Ultimate makes him attack even faster and augments
      the power of his Rend and Bloodsport. A true force of nature.

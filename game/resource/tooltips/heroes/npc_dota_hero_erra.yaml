    hype: Strangely well-rounded, Erra is a nuker with access to his signature Grave
      Guard, an ability that activates when he drops below a portion of Health and
      restores his Health and Mana rapidly for a short time. Otherwise, he has access
      to a nuke that has a reduced cooldown and Pure damage, should any of the targets
      in the AoE be below 40% Health, bonus damage gained from the missing Health
      of nearby enemies, and a devastating close range nuke/damage over time with
      his Ultimate, Deathtouch.

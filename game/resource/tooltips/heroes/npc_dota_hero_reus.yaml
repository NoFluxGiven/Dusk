    hype: "Not many Heroes can claim to have as much visceral impact with their abilities\
      \ as Reus. Rending the earth itself asunder, Reu\ts may fire stunning rocks\
      \ with Stoneblast, create slowing and damaging tremors with Magnitude, wallop\
      \ enemies into next week with Gaia's Fury, and trap his enemies and allies in\
      \ an arena that is impossible to escape-- buffing himself in the process-- with\
      \ Ancient Arena."

    hype: This cap'n is all about disrupting his enemies. His long range Physical
      nuke, Grapeshot, makes him great at consistently damaging enemies. Captain's
      Compass grants him bonus movespeed whilst moving towards his enemies, whilst
      Adventurous Gale allows him to charge forth and carry enemies with him. Should
      he be in trouble, he can summon the great Dreadnaught, a ghostly ship that fires
      numerous cannonballs ahead of it.

        of how far away the target is.\n\nUpgradable by Aghanim's Scepter.

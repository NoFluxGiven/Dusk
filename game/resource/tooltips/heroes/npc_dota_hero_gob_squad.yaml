    hype: The meaning of madness, Gob Squad cares not for self-preservation, only
      for destruction. Firing long range rockets with Rocket Blast is where the sanity
      ends-- the rest of their skillset is dangerous for everyone. Become extremely
      fast, then explode, with Kamikaze. Throw numerous bombs out of your cart with
      their Ultimate, Clearance Sale, and of course... explode anyway on death, with
      Whoops!!

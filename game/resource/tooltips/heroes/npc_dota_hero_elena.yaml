    bio: There is an old folktale the Tijadi pass down, of a mother and her young
      child. The child could speak to Spirits, but should they utter a word in return,
      they would be wrenched of their immortality, left weak and vulnerable. The Marqas,
      arbiters of order, deemed her child cursed, and banished her to the Nothing.
      As the darkness twisted around her, pulling every cell from her body for an
      agonising eternity, the true nature of her curse was discovered. The spirits
      of the old land began to die, one by one, their souls fading as the child's
      did. In a panicked realisation of their mistakes, the Marqas pulled her from
      her prison and tasked her with wandering the planes and restoring the dead or
      mortal Spirits, bestowing upon her incredible powers of regeneration and fighting
      prowess.
    hype: The healer in chief, Elena is an excellent sustainer with incredible teamfight
      capabilities. Possessing damaging/healing AoEs and an Ultimate that turns the
      opponents' attacks against them, she is difficult to deal with in any case.

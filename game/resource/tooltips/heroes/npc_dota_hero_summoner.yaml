    bio: ''
    hype: The sieger of towers, destroyer of bases, and overall one of the most annoying
      Heroes to play against, Vulcan is a defensive core that can place nests of units
      all over the map. His Tesla Coils are weak on their own, but in groups they
      are devastatingly powerful, and the Sentinel can down towers in a short time.
      His Vassal, built with an innate ability, can help him kill enemies with its
      wide set of powerful spells, but is fragile and slow.

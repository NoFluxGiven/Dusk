    bio: 'A being from a forgotten Plane, the creature known only as ''Baal'' foresaw
      that which his kind did not; the End. In his dreams he saw fire descending upon
      his people, destroying all that he knew. His fears came to a head, and with
      the help of others, he put a plan in motion; before the cataclysmic event, he
      would drag his world into the next Plane, and deal with the consequences afterwards.
      The event began as his dream foretold: a being of light and fire had formed,
      infantile and oblivious, its light singeing the edges of his home. With a cry,
      he and his comrades used all of their might to push their home through the warping
      walls of the Plane. All seemed well, until the gap widened, and an unfathomable
      force tore at the Plane. His home began to crumble as it fell through, and he
      watched with horror as the being of fire was torn from its celestial cradle,
      its form washing over and searing all that he knew to ash. As he fell into this
      new plane, his anger and guilt consumed him, his physical form a self imposed
      prison for his transgressions against his own kind.'
    hype: A positional manipulator as masterful as they are irritating, Baal's job
      is to constantly keep the enemy on their toes. Create a sphere that gradually
      slows enemies' attack and movement speed, anchor them to the ground with Spatiotemporal
      Anchor, teleport to a location after channelling with Spatial Rift, and enter
      a state of uncertainty to wreak havoc on your unsuspecting enemies with Superposition.

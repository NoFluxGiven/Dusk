    hype: A support with a set of skills designed to save allies and annoy enemies,
      Aether can drag an ally out of a bad situation with Teleport, deal damage and
      disjoint projectiles with Disrupt, place buffing Monoliths with Monolith, and
      suck all enemies and allies in the immediate area into a dimensional safe zone.

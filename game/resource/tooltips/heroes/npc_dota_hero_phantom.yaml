Hero:
  data:
    bio: ''
    hype: A spectral form that can barely be perceived, Phantasm may be fragile, but
      she is an incredibly powerful manfighter and late game carry. Possessing a cleave
      that increases its damage the more times it hits, an excellent scaling AoE nuke/slow
      that is based on her Attribute total, a devastating critical strike that deals
      more damage the lower Health the target is on, and a long range teleport that
      allows her to quickly close the distance against even the most elusive foes,
      Phantasm is a powerful and terrifying Hero.

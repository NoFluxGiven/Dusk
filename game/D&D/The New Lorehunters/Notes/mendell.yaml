        <c> summons 4 vines that can strike at their enemies. The vines act on <c>'s Initiative,
        immediately after they take their turn, and they occupy the space where the caster is at all
        times, including when they move.
        When the vines make an attack, they deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage each (instant hit) and then roll
        a +2 Grapple check as a group with an additional +2 per vine (10 total). If the grapple check succeeds, the target is restrained as per
        a regular grapple.
        The vines have 5 hit points and are vulnerable to Fire.

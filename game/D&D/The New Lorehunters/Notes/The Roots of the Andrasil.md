# WORM PROPHETS, SESSION 5
## THE ROOTS OF THE ANDRASIL

The party is traveling through the **Forest of Vis**, with the help of **Hudson**, a (spirit?) cat.

### Getting Lost

* The path ends and the underbrush becomes thicker
* Each STEP on the way is a Survival (WIS) Roll vs DC 12.
  * FAILURES: out of 3
  * SUCCESSES: out of 3, the party finds an ancient grove with the language of the Fey carved into its trees?

* Reveal the roots
* Tayla should want to touch it, so have voices speaking out to her from it
* The roots are covered in cuts and carvings, and they are slightly dessicated, as if the water has drained from them

They eventually lose their way.

A spear, tipped with green energy, flies past, narrowly avoiding Artarsh (DC 22 DEX Save to catch it).
The underbrush shimmers around them as masked warriors wearing light cloth, wielding sickle-like weapons, step *out* of the trees themselves.

A voice sounds; "lost, are we?"

**Mendell**

Tall, fair-skinned human wielding a spear tipped with wood, vines curling around it. He is convinced the party is like the *spirit-snatchers* he has seen in the last week, and elects to capture them.

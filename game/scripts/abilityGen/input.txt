##Malefic Purge

TargetType: HERO

Desc: After a {delay 1.5s} delay, the target is Strong Dispelled and recovers Health equal to {recovery 10/15/20/25%} of their missing Health. If they are an enemy, they take the amount as damage instead, and are slowed by {slow 100%} for {slow_duration 0.7S}.

##Devotion

If Elena leaves the {radius 900} effective radius, or dies, the buff is immediately dispelled.

(Happy belated Halloween, guys and gals)

ERRA, the Deathmancer

Long considered masters of death itself, the Valstrada were sworn enemies of living beings on the planes. One, however, rose above the rest in both his power and hatred of life. Erra wreaked havoc upon the planes, casting living, and dead, to the Underneath alike. Afraid of his powers, the Valstrada sealed him into a mortal form, barely able to recollect his past. Now he is but a splinter of his former self; but powerful nonetheless.

Erra is a ranged Strength carry that is highly durable in fights thanks to his Grave Guard, and can quickly demolish single targets with both his Ultimate, Deathtouch, a short range nuke, and his W, To Dust, which grants him bonus damage equal to a portion of the amount of missing Health of nearby enemies. Finally, his Q, Morbid Blade, allows him to deal large Pure damage to enemies, provided he casts it so that it hits the correct, low-Health targets.

HEROES
=========

A NEW HERO HAS BEEN ADDED!!

Orcus, the ARTIFICER
A remnant of a race long forgotten, Orcus was, amongst his people, a legendary manipulator of the energies of the World. His impressive and sometimes terrifying powers of moulding the reality around him gave some reason to be wary of his incredible abilities. One night, when the moon was shrouded, an assassin slipped into his room and planted a blade in his belly. Awakening to the throes of death, Orcus used the last of his energy to reshape not a place, or thing, but a moment; the moment of his passing. From this, incredible visions of the Voidal Chasm flooded his mind, granting him great and terrible knowledge. Seeing his madness, the Elders cast him out, into the Voidal Chasm, fearing him dangerous. Now he returns, his powers honed and ready for war.

Transform your opponents into Immobile statues, remove their Armor completely, strike them with Voidal attacks, and create a replica of a target enemy or ally unit!

His entry has been added to the Hero Tips database.

HEROES
=========

NEW HERO!

Jue, the MANA KNIGHT.

A steel tempered guardian of the sacred Alioth, this warrior was borne in the flames of dead Arcana, fed by the dissipating Magical energies of his foes. With each Mage he decimated, he grew stronger, until he finally met his match, and fell to the cunning magic of Turin. He now roams the lands as a shadow of his former glory, but be warned... his power is still as unfathomable as ever.

Crush your opponent's Mana pool, stun them with your own, create silencing glyphs, and unleash hell upon casters with this scary anti-Magic Hero!

Version 1.6

HEROES
=========

NEW HERO!

NU, the Voidal Guardian

Many beings claim to know the Void as their own, but only one can truly claim this title; Nu, the Voidal Guardian, a being of immense and often bewildering power. To this creature, bending space itself is as simple as breathing,
and it makes its home amongst the blackness of the Void.

You can crush your enemies with gravity wells, summon deadly mines of antimatter, surround your opponents in damaging micronebulae, and summon the dreaded Warpstar, to strike fear into your enemies' hearts, and manipulate their positioning.

SANGUINE HUNTER is now BLOODWARRIOR

Soul Claw => Grapple

Stuns the target for 3s and drains 4/6/8/10% of their Max Health and Max Mana per second.
Has a melee cast range, and is a channelled spell.
Bloodmarked enemies are drained for a small amount more.

Lifelink => Dance of Death
-------
The Bloodwarrior jumps to a target enemy or ally, dealing a small amount of damage to enemies.
All nearby Bloodmarked enemies take damage as well.
If jumping to a Bloodmarked enemy, the Bloodmark is consumed, and they are dealt bonus damage.

Sadistic => Red Ritual
-------
Deals large Magical damage to the target enemy, then some damage over time.
After the damage over time duration, it applies a Bloodmark to them, causing Bloodwarrior's abilities to have more effects.
If they are Bloodmarked, ministuns them, deals bonus damage and consumes the Bloodmark.

Bloodcall => Blood Curse
-------
Cursed blood runs through Vale's veins.  Unable to relinquish his blackened soul upon death, a creature remains behind to feast on his enemies.
When the Bloodwarrior would die from taking damage, he instead transforms into a Blood Fiend.
The Blood Fiend is a flying unit with a ranged attack.  It has Health, Mana, and attack damage based on the level of Bloodwarrior's Ultimate.
The Blood Fiend has 2 abilities:
FEAST: Target unit (creeps or neutrals only) is disabled for 5s.  At the end of the duration, the unit is killed, the death timer is reset, and the Blood Fiend's Health and Mana is restored to full.  Feasting successfully on 5 units will revive Bloodwarrior.
DIVE: Grants the Blood Fiend bonus movespeed and reduced damage for a short time.
If the Blood Fiend kills a Hero, or Feasts on enough creeps, Bloodwarrior is revived at the Blood Fiend's location, with full Health and Mana.
The Blood Fiend's death timer is 60s, but this can be reset by Feasting on creeps and neutrals.

~~~ THE ITEM UPDATE ~~~

Legendary items have been reintroduced, and are now called EXALTED items!  There are some new buffs to them, as you'll read below, but there are also some new restrictions:

- Only one Exalted item is allowed per player.
- Exalted items must be synthesised by upgrading a late game item using the new Regal Sigil, available in the shop.
- The Regal Sigil grants no stats and will be consumed upon use, regardless of whether the synthesisation succeeds at all (that is, unless there is an invalid item in the first slot).
- This item will always upgrade the first item it finds going from left to right, top to bottom, that is a valid item.

The main buff to all of them is that you only require the base item, and then that is upgraded.  Some items have not changed.

IMPORTANT: Items that are upgraded through Regal Sigil will possess the Exalted keyword.  Items that are powerful combinations of smaller items, such as Magisteel Armor, Vagrant's Dagger, Spellproof Bulwark and Vajra are Legendary items, and as such you can have more than one.

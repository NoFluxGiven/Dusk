	"Ability1"				"wight_betwixt"
	// The Wight targets a nearby enemy unit, leaping towards it at high speed and becoming
	// invulnerable. Upon arrival, the Wight damages and
	// hides inside the target unit for up to 3s.
	// He can then target another unit to jump to that one, or target a point to leave the unit.
	// When exiting a unit with ground targeting he deals damage at the target location.
	// The damage increases for each jump he made.
	// Has a short cooldown when jumping between units.
	// Goes on cooldown when landing at a point instead.

	// The Wight can make 3/4/5/6 unit jumps.
	// The exit command can always be cast, regardless of whether the Wight has any jumps left.
	// Deals 20/30/40/50 damage and heals the Wight for the same amount on entry.
	// Deals 100 + 20/30/40/50 damage per jump made in a 350 AoE upon exiting.
	// Has a 0.60s cooldown when jumping between units.
	// 600 cast range.
	// 15/14/13/12s cooldown.
	// If Wight remains too long in a unit, they are forced out to a random location nearby
	// as if they cast the exit ability.
	"Ability2"				"wight_wailing_souls"
	// Each time the Wight kills an enemy unit, he gains stacks of Wailing Souls.
	// Casting the ability causes a spirit to appear for each stack and enter a random nearby
	// enemy unit.
	// Whilst inside, the unit is slowed and takes damage over time.
	// Killing a Hero grants 10 stacks.
	// Max 5/10/15/20 stacks.
	// Each Spirit does 4/8/12/16 damage per second (in 0.25s intervals) and slows by 6/9/12/15%.
	// Lasts 4s.
	// The search radius is 700.
	// The spirits have a travel time of 0.4s regardless of distance.
	// They come out at intervals of 0.15s, meaning that it takes 0.75/1.5/2.25/3.00s
	// for all spirits to come out and latch to a target.
	// If there are no available nearby targets, the Spirits do not exit and Wight
	// loses no stacks.
	// The buff that releases the Spirits lasts for 5s, or until all stacks are used up.
	// 20s cooldown.
	"Ability3"				"wight_breakthrough"
	// Wight gains 4 attacks at a fixed attack rate of 1.00s.
	// If all four attacks hit one target, they are stunned.
	// The attacks deal no damage, but proc on hit effects.
	// The attacks reduce Armor by 5% of Wight's total attack damage.
	// After 4 hits, stuns for 1.75/2.5/3.25/4.00s.
	// Lasts 10s.
	// The debuff (armor) lasts 6s.
	"Ability4"				"wight_eye_of_the_guardian"
	// Upon activation, Wight gains full vision of the closest enemy Hero globally.
	// While using this ability, Wight has no vision around himself or
	// units he owns.
	// Reveals invisible units as well.
	// Lasts 8s.
	// 90/60/30s cooldown.

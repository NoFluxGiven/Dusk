	"Ability1"				"luminary_stop"
	// Luminary applies a debuff that, when he chooses, stuns and damages the target
	// based on the time it spent applied.
	// Deals 10/20/30/40 damage per second applied.
	// Stuns for 0.6/0.7/0.8/0.9s per second applied.
	// Maximum debuff duration is 4s.
	// The maximum stun is therefore 2.4/2.8/3.2/3.6s.
	// Undispellable.
	// The stun freezes their cooldowns.
	// If the spell is not activated before the debuff ends, the stun and damage applies
	// as if it were held for 1s.
	// 26/24/22/20s cooldown.
	"Ability2"				"luminary_chronal_emission"
	// Luminary fires a bolt at the target location, creating an area of temporal flux.
	// Enemies within take damage over time, and their cooldowns tick up instead of down.
	// Slows enemies by 30%.
	// Deals 12/24/36/48 damage per second.
	// 375 radius.
	// Lasts 6s.
	"Ability3"				"luminary_timewefter"

	// The buff/debuff lasts 0.75/1.00/1.25/1.50s.
	// 500 radius.
	// Slows enemies' movespeed, attack speed, cooldown ticks and cast points by 50%.
	// Increases allies' movespeed, attack speed, cooldown ticks and cast points by 50%.
	// Every 0.2s while applied, increases enemy cooldowns and decreases ally cooldowns by 0.1s.
	"Ability4"				"luminary_cast_stop"
	// Activates Stop.
	"Ability5"				"generic_hidden"
	"Ability6"				"luminary_temporal_overload"
	// Enemies within a large radius take damage based on the total tallied cooldowns of all
	// of their basic Abilities, and all their debuffs gain additional duration.
	// Deals 20/25/30 damage per second tallied, and refreshes any debuffs on enemies, increasing their duration by 10/20/30%.
	// 18s is the average tally, so this would be 360/450/540 damage.
	// AGHANIM'S SCEPTER UPGRADE: Applies Stop to 1/2/3 enemy Heroes with the highest cooldown tally.

	// based on the amount of units infected.
	// Deals 20/30/40 damage per Hero infected per second (including the initial infection target) and a bonus 5 damage per creep infected.
	// Infection spreads instantly when infected targets move within a 325 radius of another unit. Newly infected units do not spread the infection until after a 2s grace period.

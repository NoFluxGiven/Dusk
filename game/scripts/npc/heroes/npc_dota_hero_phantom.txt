	//// REWORK

	// Q - Spectral Step

	// Phantom jumps to a target spot, draining Health from nearby enemies and temporarily rendering herself and her enemies Ethereal.
	// Ethereal enemies take 40% bonus Magical damage, cannot attack, and are slowed by 50%, but are immune to Physical damage.
	// While Ethereal from this effect, Phantom has the same effects, except she instead takes 20% bonus Magical damage, moves 15% faster,
	// and can attack Ethereal enemies, with her attacks dealing Magical damage for the duration.
	// 500/600/700/800 range.
	// 275 radius.
	// Lasts 3/4/5/6s.

	// W - Violent Echoes

	// When Phantom kills an enemy Hero, she gains an Echo stack.
	// The next time she makes an attack against another Hero, an additional attack is made every 1.00s per stack, preserving all procs.
	// Undispellable.

	// E - Psychic Scream

	// Phantom unleashes a wave of psychic energy that slows and Silences enemies and allies in a radius, dealing Magical damage to enemies.
	// Both enemies and allies are Silenced and slowed by 30/40/50/60%.
	// Lasts 3/4/5/6s for enemies and 2s for allies.
	// Deals 140/200/260/320 damage.
	// 500 radius.
	// Phantom is unaffected.

	// R - Nightmare

	// Pulls the energies of the Nightmare realm into this reality, surrounding herself with them.
	// Enemies in range cannot recover Health or Mana, and cannot be targeted by allied Spells or Items.

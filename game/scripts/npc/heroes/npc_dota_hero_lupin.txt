	"Ability1"				"lupin_darting_shadow" // Lupin dashes towards the target enemy, dealing some Magical damage to enemies on the way. When he arrives
	// he deals critical damage to the enemy.
	// Dashes with a range of 700.
	// Deals 65/95/125/155 damage to units passed through.
	// Each unit passed through grants 20/25/30/35 damage to Lupin for 6s.
	// Creeps always grant 15.
	// The main target is struck by an attack immediately upon arrival. The attack is a 175% critical strike, preserving all procs and UAMs.
	// Darting Shadow's damage refreshes the Daze duration on Dazed units.
	"Ability2"				"lupin_flashbang" // Lupin throws down a flash grenade that severely limits enemies' abilities to fight. Within a 350 radius, all enemies are
	// dazed for 0.80/1.60/2.40/3.20s. Dazed enemies are stunned until they take damage.
	"Ability3"				"lupin_quickdraw" // Lupin quickly draws and fires his gun at a target. This ability has 3 charges. Each shot on the same target has compounding effects. The charges come back at a rate of
	// 1 every 12s.

	// The first shot deals damage and slows by 8/12/16/20% for 2s.
	// The second shot deals damage, extends the slow duration by 2s, and slows attack speed by 20/40/60/80.
	// The third shot deals damage, 30/40/50/60 bonus damage, and stuns the target for 0.75/1.00/1.25/1.50s.

	// All shots have a base damage of 40/50/60/70. This means the total base damage of all three shots is 120/150/180/210. Including bonus damage, the total damage is 150/200/240/280.
	// All shots simulate an attack that deals 0 damage, in that they apply attack effects.
	// Shots deal Physical damage.

	// Lupin's level 25 doubles the damage of all shots. This means the total damage of all three shots, including bonus damage, would be: 300/380/460/540 damage.

	"Ability4"				"lupin_ephemera" // Instantly places a buff on all allied Heroes and their controlled units. After a 0.4s delay, they become invisible for 8s, moving 10/20/30% faster
	// and dealing 50/75/100 bonus damage on their next attack out of invisibility. If all affected Heroes attack the same enemy out of invisibility, it stuns them for 1.5s.

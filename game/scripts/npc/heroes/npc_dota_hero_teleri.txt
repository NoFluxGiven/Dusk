	"Ability1"				"teleri_shock_arrow"
	// Teleri readies her bow, then looses an electric bolt that deals damage and slows the target.
	// The bolt has a fast travel time and deals 60/120/180/240 damage, slowing by 100% for 1s.
	// When the bolt lands, after the slow duration, it explodes, propagating to enemies in an
	// area behind the target, and applying an attack. The attack preserves all procs.
	// The ability cannot propagate to enemies it has already affected in the same cast.
	// Applies the same effect to all enemies in a 250 radius 175 units away from the target.
	// This is based on Teleri's current position.
	// 9s cooldown.
	"Ability2"				"teleri_tijadis_gambit"
	// Teleri invokes the power of her tribe, marking, then striking, 3 random targets in a radius with lightning
	// bolts that deal damage and ministun, after a delay.
	// Teleri may be struck by the bolts as well.
	// If Teleri is struck by a bolt, she takes far less damage, and is empowered, gaining
	// regen, movespeed and attackspeed for a short time. Stacks fully.
	// After a 1s delay, deals 100/175/250/325 damage to each target in a 700 radius
	// and ministuns for 0.4s.
	// If Teleri is hit by a bolt, she takes 60% less damage from it, is still ministunned,
	// and gains 16/32/48/64 Health regen, 30/40/50/60 attack speed and 8/12/16/20% movespeed for 5s.
	// The bolts have a 0.4s delay between them. Bolts can only hit each unit once, with
	// the exception of Teleri.
	// Damage Teleri takes from this ability is non-lethal.
	// 14s cooldown.
	// If Teleri is hit with all 3 Bolts, she receives the following:
	// 390 damage
	// 1.2s stun
	// 192 Health Regen (960 Health regained)
	// 180 attack speed
	// 80% movespeed
	"Ability3"				"teleri_grace_of_the_thunder_archer"
	// Teleri unleashes a blast of electrical energy that empowers herself and a nearby target ally,
	// increasing their movespeed, and granting Evasion for a short time.
	// The next attack her or her target makes is empowered, unleashing an arc of electricity that slows, damages
	// and reduces the magic resistance of the attack target.
	// The on-attack effect does not activate for the first 0.5s.
	// Grants 30/35/40/45% movespeed and 70% Evasion for 3.00/4.00/5.00/6.00s to both Teleri and her ally.
	// The on-attack effect deals 60/120/180/240 Magical damage, slows by 10/30/50/70%, and reduces Magic res by
	// 30% for 2s. It applies even if the attack misses.

	"Ability5"				"generic_hidden"
	"Ability6"				"teleri_blitz"
	// Unleashes a storm of electric arrows upon the target area, dealing damage in random locations.

	// The arrows land every 0.10s over a 2s duration.
	// 275 radius.
	// 90s cooldown.

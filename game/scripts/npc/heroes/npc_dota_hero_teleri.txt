	"Ability1"				"teleri_shock_arrow"
	// Teleri readies her bow, then looses an electric bolt that deals damage and slows the target.
	// The bolt has no travel time and deals 60/120/180/240 damage, slowing by 100% for 1s.
	// When the bolt lands, it propagates to enemies in an area behind the target, and applies
	// an attack. The attack preserves all procs.
	// Applies the same effect to all enemies in a 250 radius 175 units away from the target.
	// This is based on Teleri's current position.
	// 9s cooldown.
	"Ability2"				"teleri_tijadis_gambit"
	// Teleri invokes the power of her tribe, striking 3 random targets in a radius with lightning
	// bolts that deal damage and ministun, after a delay.
	// Teleri may be struck by the bolts as well.
	// If Teleri is struck by a bolt, she takes far less damage, and is empowered, gaining
	// regen, movespeed and attackspeed for a short time. Stacks fully.
	// After a 1s delay, deals 100/175/250/325 damage to each target in a 700 radius
	// and ministuns for 0.4s.
	// If Teleri is hit by a bolt, she takes 50% less damage from it, is still ministunned,
	// and gains 8/16/24/32 Health regen, 30/40/50/60 attack speed and 10/20/30% movespeed for 4s.
	// The bolts have a 0.2s delay between them. Bolts can only hit each unit once, with
	// the exception of Teleri.
	// Damage Teleri takes from this ability is non-lethal.
	// 14s cooldown.
	// If Teleri is hit with all 3 Bolts, she receives the following:
	// 489 damage
	// 96 Health Regen (384 Health regained, so reduces total damage to 105)
	// 180 attack speed
	// 90% movespeed
	"Ability3"				"teleri_grace_of_the_thunder_archer"
	// Teleri dashes towards a closeby location, gaining bonus attack speed and attacking
	// units on the way.
	// Dashes up to 400 units away, gaining 30/60/90/120 attack speed for 2s.
	// As she dashes, up to 2/3/4/5 random enemies within her attack range are attacked once.
	// The dash takes 0.3s to complete.
	// 4s cooldown.

	"Ability6"				"teleri_blitz"
	// Unleashes a storm of electric arrows upon the target area, dealing damage in random locations.
	// Each arrow deals her base damage + 30/50/70 bonus as Magical damage in a 75 radius.
	// The arrows land every 0.20s over a 3s duration, and have a 15/20/25% chance to apply her attack
	// modifiers on the hit targets (as a 0 damage attack.)
	// 275 radius.
	// 90s cooldown.

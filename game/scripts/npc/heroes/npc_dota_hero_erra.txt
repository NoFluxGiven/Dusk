	"Ability1"				"erra_morbid_blade" // Erra strikes a target area with the wind of the Black Tide, slicing through enemies in it. Deals Physical damage, but if any units hit
	// are at 35% or less Health, it deals Pure damage instead, and its cooldown is halved. Erra gains Health back based on the Health missing from enemy targets. Gains 1/2/3/4% Health
	// for each target AFTER the damage occurs.
	"Ability2"				"erra_to_dust" // When cast, grants Erra bonus damage based off the missing Health of all nearby enemy Heroes and creeps. Grants 6/8/10/12% of the missing
	// Health of enemy Heroes, and 2% of the missing Health of creeps at the time. Lasts 12s. 5 enemy Heroes with 50% Health and 650 Max Health would grant 195 damage at Max level.
	"Ability3"				"erra_grave_guard" // Erra finds it difficult to succumb to death, thanks to a dark enchantment cast upon him many eons ago. When he would die, he
	// becomes immune to damage for a short time and gains back 25/30/35/40% of his Max Health and Mana over 2/3/4/5s. The ability goes on cooldown after this point.
	"Ability4"				"erra_deathtouch" // With but a touch, Erra can rip souls asunder, dealing massive Magical damage, then damage over time. Deals 460/580/700 damage immediately,
	// then 35/40/45 damage per second for 10s.

ALEXANDER

Hello and welcome to the Dusk Hero Spotlight for Alexander. Alexander is a melee Strength carry that can survive onslaughts of damage that would kill other Heroes.

His first ability is called Soulseal. Casting this on an enemy will cause them to become silenced for a long period, and slow their movespeed significantly.

His second ability is Steadfast. This grants bonus Armor and Health regen as his Health drops lower.

Radiant is his third ability, granting him bonus Health regen and causing enemy attacks to miss when near him.

Finally, his Ultimate is Godfall. After a short channel time, he deals massive bonus Pure damage, mini-stuns, and purges off positive buffs on his next attack.

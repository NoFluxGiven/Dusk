GOB SQUAD

Hello and welcome to a Dusk Hero Spotlight for Gob Squad. Gob Squad is a ranged Intelligence Hero with an odd focus on sacrificing himself to deal massive damage to the enemy team.

Their first ability is Rocket Blast. This fires a rocket from a long range, dealing Magical damage in an AoE. If it hits a building directly, it deals the AoE damage, and deals a quarter of the damage to the building.

Their second ability is Kamikaze. After a 4s delay, in which they gains a large amount of bonus movespeed, they explode, losing a percentage of their Health, and becoming stunned, to deal damage in an AoE that scales with the Health they lost.

Next up is Whoops! This ability, so named, causes them to explode when they die, dealing large Magical damage in a large radius. They also stun enemies affected for a short time.

Finally, their Ultimate is Clearance Sale. The Gob Squad will offload all the bombs they have, throwing them in random directions. When the bombs land, they explode, dealing Magical damage in a small area. The Gob Squad takes half the damage from this ability.
